<strong><i>Abstract: </i></strong>High sensitivity radio searches of unassociated γ-ray sources have proven to be an effective way of finding new pulsars. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during its commissioning phase, we have carried out a number of targeted deep searches of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) γ-ray sources. On Feb. 27th, 2018 we discovered an isolated millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR J0318+0253, coincident with the unassociated γ-ray source 3FGL J0318.1+0252. PSR J0318+0253 has a spin period of 5.19 milliseconds, a dispersion measure (DM) of 26 pc cm<sup>-3</sup> corresponding to a DM distance of about 1.3 kpc, a period-averaged flux density of ∼11 ± 2 μJy at L-band. Among all high energy MSPs, PSR J0318+0253 is the faintest ever detected in radio bands, by a factor of at least ∼4 in terms of L-band fluxes. With the aid of the radio ephemeris, an analyses of 9.6 years of Fermi-LAT data revealed that PSR J0318+0253 also displays strong γ-ray pulsations. Follow-up observations carried out by both Arecibo and FAST suggest a likely spectral turnover around 350 MHz. This is the first result from the collaboration between FAST and the Fermi-LAT collaboration as well as the first confirmed new MSP discovery by FAST, raising hopes for the detection of many more MSPs. Such discoveries will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the neutron star zoo as well as potentially contributing to the future detection of gravitational waves, via pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments.
